							<p><strong>Introduction to Agent-Based Computing</strong></p>
								<p>Week 1 of the module started off with one chapter from <em>An Introduction to MultiAgent Systems by Michael Wooldridge</em> and a lecturecast to the Introduction Of Agent Based Computing. Surprisingly unlike the Machine Learning module (currently enrolled in a double module), I found the reading list for Intelligence Agents more informative than the lecture cast. I have to admit I do not like most of the lecture casts provided by the University. The audio quality is poor, the information seems vague and sometimes even non-cohesive, and the short quizzes within the lecture casts have a few errors.</p>
								<p>Our tutor, Oliver Buckley, conducted the first seminar for this module & I found it quite helpful. I would prefer if the seminars were conducted earlier in the week so we could follow up on topics using the recommended reading lists. This approach worked for me in the past, but given the tight scheduling by the University, it sets me back a week.</p>
							        <p>The formative activity for this week was a collaborative discussion, and I did not post into the discussion forum but instead attached my piece above.</p>
							        <p>What stood out for me this week was the term <em>Adjustable Autonomy</em>. <blockquote>Sometimes, we may be cautious about unleashing an agent on the world. We may want to build in some degree of limited autonomy or, more generally, equip the agent with some type of adjustable autonomy [Scerri et al., 2003]</blockquote> I'm sure we've experienced some form of Adjustable Autonomy in our lives, so why don't we have ethical frameworks in place? I need to further research this.</p>

							<p><strong>Introducing First Order Logic</strong></p>
								<p>The project groups have been made this week. My group consists of Sam Adeniyi & Kazuma Hazebayashi, which is great because we've all been working together as a big group in the unofficial UoE Essex Whatsapp group.</p>
							        <p>Week 2 looks at 'First Order Logic'. I have no experience with this topic, so it's safe to assume that I'm starting a level 1. Oliver's seminar was put together well & it definitely took away the apprehensiveness I had about First Order Logic. The session was interactive, but I logged out early & watched the recorded seminar later </p>
							<p></p>
							<p><strong>Agent Architectures</strong></p>
								<p>I feel lost this week.  The reading list consisted of five articles which are relatively long & technical. They covered topics like Agent Network Architecture (ANN), approach to the design of embedded agents, practical reasoning of agent architecture, the approach to building an intelligent robot that operates without supervision, and a behavioural model inspired by a flock of birds. After reading <em>
                                                                 Flocks, herds and schools: A distributed behavioral model in ACM SIGGRAPH Computer Graphics by Craig W.Reynolds</em>, I learned that in order to solve the issue of individual behaviours among intelligenct agents dominating the system, decisions are made based on the priority of the situation. If this concept is simplified and well communicated to the general public, it could help de-mystify the workings of AI-based machines & increase overall acceptance.</p>
							<p></p>
							<p><strong>Hybrid Agent Architectures</strong></p>
								<p>Week 4 was uneventful in terms of the literature. The VitalSource page through which our core e-book is accessed, does not have a clickable Table Of Contents, making it inconvenient to skip to different chapters. This week , we covered hybrid architecture types. </p>
							        <p>Anastasia Rizzo joined our team & we have begun working on Multi- Agent System (MAS) project. During our team call, roles were decided & we chose 'Academic Research' as the task that our MAS will focus on. 
							<p></p>
							<p><strong>Agent Communication</strong></p>
								<p>Week 5 lecture cast covered Agent Communication .Speech Acts was one of the topics included. It describes how types of speech have consequnces. I found it quite interesting & continued to read  <em>Speech Acts : An Essay in the Philosophy of Language by John R.Searle</em> My speech act in this reflection is 'expressive' towards the quality of the lecture cast audio.</p>
							        <p>The project is coming along well. We've conducted another team video call to iron out a few bumps in the MAS architecture reagrding how many agents are essential. However, scheduling calls has been tougher than expected no thanks to the four of us living in three different timezones.</p>
							        <p></p>   
							<p></p>
							<p><strong>Working Together</strong></p>
								<p>I skipped the reading & the collaborative discussion for this week, to focus on our upcoming deliverable. This past week has been mentally exhausting & there are moments where I doubt if my work is up to industry standards. My background in User Experience Research & Design makes me question : are complicating our project? , are we clearly communicating our goals to the end user & if so, are we able to explain to the user in simple terms, how we've designed this multi-agent system? I'm comfortable with communicating & work with different personalities, and so I've volunteered to take up the general team management role.</p>

							<p><strong> Natural Language Processing (NLP)</strong></p>
							        <p>Week 7 focused on Natural Language Processing (NLP). I was looking forward to this week as I covered NLP in one of my previous courses from the DeepLearning.org.</p>
							        <p> The reading list covered the Skip Gram Model, automatic acquisition of semantic lexical relations (this was a tough paper to read and you can find it <em><a href="https://aclanthology.org/C92-2082/">here</a></em>) ,and handwriting recognition using neural networks & image processing. I noticed that these papers mostly considered the English language to perfrom NLP. Being multilingual, I find it easier to mix languages when communicating with different parts of my family because 'English' on its own is more polysemous than German or Hindi. If we attempt performing NLP with less polysemous languages, can we use regression on these languages & translate the output?</p>
							<p></p>
							<p><strong>Introduction to Adaptive Algorithms</strong></p>
								<p>Week 8 covered Parse Trees , which with I initially had no experience. Thanks to the recommended reading - <em><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/getting-to-grips-with-parse-trees-6e19e7cd3c3c">Getting to grips with parse trees</a></em>), I was able to enjoy my 'Parse Tree' journey.</p>
