							<p><strong>Introduction to Agent-Based Computing</strong></p>
								<p>Week 1 of the module started off with one chapter from <em>An Introduction to MultiAgent Systems by Michael Wooldridge</em> and a lecturecast to the Introduction Of Agent Based Computing. Surprisingly unlike the Machine Learning module (currently enrolled in a double module), I found the reading list for Intelligence Agents more informative than the lecture cast. I have to admit I do not like most of the lecture casts provided by the University. The audio quality is poor, the information seems vague and sometimes even non-cohesive, and the short quizzes within the lecture casts have a few errors.</p>
								<p>Our tutor, Oliver Buckley, conducted the first seminar for this module & I found it quite helpful. I would prefer if the seminars were conducted earlier in the week so we could follow up on topics using the recommended reading lists. This approach worked for me in the past, but given the tight scheduling by the University, it sets me back a week.</p>
							        <p>The formative activity for this week was a collaborative discussion, and I did not post into the discussion forum but instead attached my piece above.</p>
							        <p>What stood out for me this week was the term <em>Adjustable Autonomy</em>. <blockquote>Sometimes, we may be cautious about unleashing an agent on the world. We may want to build in some degree of limited autonomy or, more generally, equip the agent with some type of adjustable autonomy [Scerri et al., 2003]</blockquote> I'm sure we've experienced some form of Adjustable Autonomy in our lives, so why don't we have ethical frameworks in place? I need to further research this.</p>

							<p><strong>Introducing First Order Logic</strong></p>
								<p>The project groups have been made this week. My group consists of Sam Adeniyi & Kazuma Hazebayashi, which is great because we've all been working together as a big group in the unofficial UoE Essex Whatsapp group.</p>
							        <p>Week 2 looks at 'First Order Logic'. I have no experience with this topic, so it's safe to assume that I'm starting a level 1. Oliver's seminar was put together well & it definitely took away the apprehensiveness I had about First Order Logic. The session was interactive, but I logged out early & watched the recorded seminar later </p>
							
							<p><strong>Agent Architectures</strong></p>
								<p>I feel lost this week.  The reading list consisted of five articles which are relatively long & technical. They covered topics like Agent Network Architecture (ANN), approach to the design of embedded agents, practical reasoning of agent architecture, the approach to building an intelligent robot that operates without supervision, and a behavioural model inspired by a flock of birds.</p>
