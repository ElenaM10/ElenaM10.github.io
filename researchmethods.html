							<h2>Reflections</h2>
							<p><strong>Scientific Investigation & Ethics</strong></p>
								<p>The module started with an intimidating (in quantity) reading list, short quizzes and a collaborative discussion that took place over 3 weeks.  <p>
								<p>For the collaborative discussion, we were asked to review the application of ethics and its overall impacts on the computing professionals from the case study of our choice, provided by the <a href="https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics">Association of Computing Machinery (ACM)</a>.</p>
							        <p><a href="https://ethics.acm.org/code-of-ethics/using-the-code/case-dark-ux-patterns/"> Case Study: Dark UX patterns</a> were an obvious pick for me, given my UX background. Not only did I relate to this case on a professional level but also as a consumer. Ironically, I was recently billed through Apple for a LinkedIn Premium subscription without being notified. I was refunded the full amount but spent quite some time placing the request. I found it unethical that LinkedIn could not help me with the refund process as it was processed through a third party. I admit that I might have overlooked something informing me about this charge. Still, for two big companies like LinkedIn and Apple, I did not receive an email informing me of this charge.</p>

							<p><strong>Research Question, Literature Review & Research Proposal</strong></p>
								<p>Thanks to the short videos on the VLE for quickly explaining what a research question is, how we settle on one and laying down the basic foundational knowledge to move ahead with the literature review and research proposal. </p>
							        <p>I have now turned to quick videos on YouTube that cover the above topics because the reading list is currently impossible to tackle with a regular weekday routine. For a part-time MSc, this course can be demanding if I follow the traditional approach. Short videos have helped me understand what is required for the task and have allowed me to devote the rest of my time to research.</p>
							        <p>I am a novice at research and often spend too much time on papers that seem promising. I need to look for hacks that professional or expert researchers use to scan through papers quickly. </p>
							        <p>Finally found my topic for my literature review & research proposal. An easy-to-read paper by<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-43176-w"> T. R. A. Kral et al(2023)</a> . </p>
							        <p>Entering week 3 of the research module, I have bookmarked the visualisation by <a href="https://methods.sagepub.com/methods-map">Sage Research Methods Map</a> and the explanation of <a href="https://research-methodology.net/research-methodology/research-design/#_ftn2"> Research Design</a> as tools for my dissertation writing process. Still battling a busy schedule, I have decided to focus on the high-priority deliverables (literature review & research proposal) and tackle the formative tasks later.</p>
