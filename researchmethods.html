							<h2>Reflections</h2>
							<p><strong>Scientific Investigation & Ethics</strong></p>
								<p>The module started with an intimidating (in quantity) reading list, short quizzes and a collaborative discussion that took place over 3 weeks.  <p>
								<p>For the collaborative discussion, we were asked to review the application of ethics and its overall impacts on the computing professionals from the case study of our choice, provided by the <a href="https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics">Association of Computing Machinery (ACM)</a>.</p>
							        <p><a href="https://ethics.acm.org/code-of-ethics/using-the-code/case-dark-ux-patterns/"> Case Study: Dark UX patterns</a> were an obvious pick for me, given my UX background. Not only did I relate to this case on a professional level but also as a consumer. Ironically, I was recently billed through Apple for a LinkedIn Premium subscription without being notified. I was refunded the full amount but spent quite some time placing the request. I found it unethical that LinkedIn could not help me with the refund process as it was processed through a third party. I admit that I might have overlooked something informing me about this charge. Still, for two big companies like LinkedIn and Apple, I did not receive an email informing me of this charge.</p>

							<p></p>
							<p><strong>Research Question, Literature Review & Research Proposal</strong></p>
								<p>Thanks to the short videos on the VLE for quickly explaining what a research question is, how we settle on one and laying down the basic foundational knowledge to move ahead with the literature review and research proposal. </p>
							        <p>I have now turned to quick videos on YouTube that cover the above topics because the reading list is currently impossible to tackle with a regular weekday routine. For a part-time MSc, this course can be demanding if I follow the traditional approach. Short videos have helped me understand what is required for the task and have allowed me to devote the rest of my time to research.</p>
							        <p>I am a novice at research and often spend too much time on papers that seem promising. I need to look for hacks that professional or expert researchers use to scan through papers quickly. </p>
							        <p>Finally found my topic for my literature review & research proposal. An easy-to-read paper by<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-43176-w"> T. R. A. Kral et al(2023)</a> . </p>
							        <p>Entering week 3 of the research module, I have bookmarked the visualisation by <a href="https://methods.sagepub.com/methods-map">Sage Research Methods Map</a> and the explanation of <a href="https://research-methodology.net/research-methodology/research-design/#_ftn2"> Research Design</a> as tools for my dissertation writing process. Still battling a busy schedule, I have decided to focus on the high-priority deliverables (literature review & research proposal) and tackle the formative tasks later.</p>
							<p></p>
							<p><strong>Case Studies, Focus Groups & Observations</strong></p>
								<p>After reading the <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10664-008-9102-8">Guidelines for conducting and reporting case study research in software engineering</a>, I realised I have unknowingly been doing exploratory and explanatory research. 
Still trying to figure out how much time is ideal to devote to research, I turned to the internet for all my answers and found the longest research conducted in history - Harvard Study Of Adult Development (nearly 80 years). The Harvard Gazette sums it up well in this <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/04/over-nearly-80-years-harvard-study-has-been-showing-how-to-live-a-healthy-and-happy-life/"> article. </a></p>
								<p>Week 5 & 6 covered interview and survey methods, and questionnarie design. Having already done this in detail during my UX Research & Design course, I decided to briefly scan through the week's contents.</p>
							<p></p>
							<p><strong>Validity and Generalisability in Research</strong></p>
								<p>Week 7 was hectic as the Literature review was due. No matter how many examples of different types of literature reviews I looked at, I could understand why it was required. The combination of stress and no sleep has been affecting all my senses.</p>
								<p>The chapter on Qualitative Research from the book<a href="https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/universityofessex-ebooks/detail.action?docID=264813#">Evaluating the Organizational Impact of Health Care Information Systems</a> , was quite familiar to me. The only difference between UX Research and scientific research is the data analysis.</p>
							<p></p>
							<p><strong>Inferential Statistics</strong></p>
								<p>For week 8 , I decided to postpone the reading and formative activities until after my Research Proposal Presentation. Again, the week has been hectic. </p>
								<p>Caught up with the statistical worksheets in week 9 & 10. I enjoyed this week as we had covered these topics of hypothesis testing & charts in our Numerical Analysis module and this was finally a math related activity.</p>
								<p>Going over the requirements for the Research Proposal Presentation assignment & I am more confused as I work through it. To me, a Research Proposal is a document that represents the viability of the research. However, for our assignment, we are required to cover Data analysis & the results. I need to reconfirm if this is the expected standard once I have the time.</p>
							<p></p>
							<p><strong>Project Management & Managing Risk</strong></p>
								<p>It is safe to say that this final week sums up the way I have been working through my MSc in AI - managing risks. I began my MSc in AI a month before I gave birth to my daughter. Being a new mother, I thought I could plan to finish my projects early & complete all reading lists on time, but reality set in.</p>
								<p>There's one thing I learned from the past few modules, theres never a perfect project where you are 100% satisfied with the efforts and results. A decision needs to be made to focus on the high-priority tasks while the rest can take a backseat.</p>
								<p>With the help of my agile methods, I have managed to deliver every project with good results. Comparing myself to how I managed my time & priorities at the beginning of this course, I couldn't be happier with my development.</p>
